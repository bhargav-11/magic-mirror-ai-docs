## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

#### What is Magic Mirror AI?
Magic Mirror AI is a photo-based application that uses advanced artificial intelligence to generate hyper-personalized avatars of children in different professions. With just a few photos of a child, parents can select a profession, and our AI will create realistic images showing the child in that role.

#### How do I get started with Magic Mirror AI?
1. Download the app from the App Store or Google Play Store
2. Create an account using your email
3. Purchase credits or use your welcome credits
4. Upload photos of your child
5. Select a profession
6. Generate your avatars!

#### Is Magic Mirror AI safe for my child's photos?
Yes. We take privacy and security very seriously. We use industry-standard encryption to protect all uploaded photos. Photos are stored for only 30 days after avatar generation and then automatically deleted from our servers. Please review our [Privacy Policy](link-to-privacy-policy) for more details.

#### What ages work best with Magic Mirror AI?
Our AI works best with children aged 3-15 years. However, you can try with any age and see the results!

#### Are unused credits refundable?
No, credits are non-refundable once purchased. However, credits remain valid for 12 months from the date of purchase.

### Avatar Generation

#### How many photos should I upload?
For best results, we recommend uploading 3-5 clear photos of the child's face from different angles. Maximum upload limit is 8 photos.

#### Why didn't my avatar turn out as expected?
Avatar quality depends on several factors:
- Photo quality (lighting, clarity, angles)
- Facial visibility in uploaded photos
- Variety of expressions and angles

Try uploading different photos with good lighting and clear facial features.

#### How long does avatar generation take?
Avatars are typically generated within 30-60 seconds, depending on your internet connection and server load.

#### Can I generate avatars of adults?
Magic Mirror AI is optimized for children's features. While you can try with adult photos, results may vary and might not be as accurate.
